May the force be with you.
Use the force, you must.
Do or do not, there is no try.
Always pass on what you have learned.
Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force.
But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.
If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.
